### DIY Droners #11: HKU Gallant Ho Group  06 June 2020
HKU group introduction. 
2 PM - 3 PM. Online and offline 

* link to meeting https://hku.zoom.us/j/964500620

* **ALL OF THE HKU GROUP NEED GITHUB USER NAME and email their user names. michael@makerbay.org**
* **HKU Team needs to learn the basics of Github documentantion and start to build thier respective team folders**
* **[Look here for some help getting started](https://github.com/MakerBay/Coral_Reef_Mapping_Drone/tree/master/How%20to%20Github)**

- Introductions slides from Sanjeew 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hG_wmvLGKJy04nseDqMUr2UWn9EACY6sUKYPFRUC6fM/edit?usp=sharing
- Introductions of team – name- specialization- interests
- Git-hub overview
- HKU team needs a Git-hub user ID
- HKU Team needs to learn how to use github and document on Git-hub (learn Markdown)
- Overview of different teams: SLIDE 22 
- Mechanical: industrial design. First we need to get results from V2 before V3 Design Direction.
- Electrical: integrating different hardware- wiring, connectors usability)
- Marine Biology: Coral Identification, environmental sensors
- Camera and Optics:  is the most crucial part of this project and we are the furthest behind.
- Software Navigation: Ardu-pilot
- Software:  AI Coral Classifier
- Sanjeew update on Coral pre-trained model. Where are we on this task and where is it on Github
- HKU Team needs to commit a number of hours per week- not just on saturday. 
- Yes, some of these hours will be “home-work” but it would be much more beneficial if these hours are committed to onsite at Makerbay     Tsuen Wan workshop. 1. With others and 2. In front of the hardware
