### Main takeaways for next revision
- Stronger telescopic poles to increase tension
- Raise pole above water
- Propulsion boat needs to be a lot more stable
- Camera and rope flippped in wave, consider rigid camera rope/ pole
- Trial a circle structure instead of arc




# DIY Droners 18 July 2020: 

## Electronics Team 
### Sanjeew, Priyank, Abhi, Naman
- Electronics team was not in attendance
- PLEASE UPDATE progress and status

- Michael T Please update Pi Progress 

## Software: Navigation / Ardupilot  
### Sanjeew, Naman
- Naman please update progress on Autopilot on Mission Planner 

## Mechanical Team 
### Brad, Paul, Duy, Michael, Cesar 
- Brad and Duy researched various new concepts (see photos of sketches below) 
- Decided to develop "Bow and Arrow" concept with 5 "faux" gro pros and fins, instead of "pink-bot" concept. 
- Wide surface of "Bow and Arrow" concept area mean GPS will be easier to lock and calibrate
- [Testing the bow and camera arrows concept](https://github.com/MakerBay/Coral_Reef_Mapping_Drone/wiki/Testing-the-bow-and-camera-arrows-concept) Issues to consider and resolve listed here
- Saturday 25th Cesar to bring an RC boat and hack it for adding to the front of 'Bow and Arrow" concept, attach with bearing to allow steering (see photos of sketches below) 
- Cesar will bring a android phone to hack for the GPS device for this test
- Need to get thicker tent poles for stronger and more rigid frame and structure
- We will test RC bow and arrow at outside the patrolled area at [Approach beach](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Approach+Beach/@22.3674087,114.0842736,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3403f91871ddc579:0xaea5bea2d3a23a3b!8m2!3d22.3674554!4d114.0860115) on 25th July

## Debrief of Field Trip
### What Went Well
- Remote control
- Visibility at site location: lots of corals

### Areas of Improvement / Problems / Concerns 
- Team work: better job distribution: can have more than 1 test going on simutaneously
- Tangled rope - need to brainstorm ways to ensure rope does not get tangled in water if it is to be used next test
- Battery - need more spare batteries
- Autopilot connection: failed to connect throigh telemetry
- First aid: shoes, cuts, sunburn - bring along next trip
- Pi connection issue
- Condensation in the battery pack - use silicone beads?
- Accessibility to parts: needs mechanical design rework

### Test Site
- Inconvenient to get there
- Best test site so far for corals, but we came in unprepared: need to get basic navigation sorted
