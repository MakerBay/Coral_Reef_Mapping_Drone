# Coral Reef Mapping Drone
## An open source ocean water drone used for mapping and analyzing the health of coral reefs

### What we're doing ? 
We are designing a Coral Reef Mapping Drone

### But, what exactly is this? 
Basically, we want to design and fabricate an ocean robot, think remote control boat but that has high quality cameras for capturing what's under the surface and then the ability to set it to autonomous cruise mode and our sailing robot will return after 3 hours with lots of images of coral reefs for scientists to analyse. Whats' more is that our robot will be able to analyse the coral itself with onboard A.I features. 

### Why are we doing this? 

Coral reefs are essential to healthy coasts and vibrant economies, playing a critical role in everything from protecting lives and property to supporting thousands of businesses.
Climate change is the biggest threat to the world’s coral reefs, causing mass bleaching, among other things.

The third global bleaching event, from 2014 to 2017, brought mass bleaching-level heat stress to more than 75 percent of global reefs; nearly 30 percent also suffered mortality level stress. This bleaching event was the longest, most widespread, and most destructive on record.

“There are efforts to use drones or satellites to collect this information, but you cannot get the high resolution needed to assess the vital complex architecture of reefs unless you are in the water,”

### What are our targets ? 

 
**Goal:** we map coral reefs + we collect metadata
*10x faster than current methods
*10x more accurate than current methods 
*10x cheaper than state of the art

**Subject:** we focus on shallow water coral reef <10m depth

**Price:** we want to make it affordable enough <2500USD

**Usability:** deployable from the beach with an autonomy >90 minutes

**Target users:** ocean scientist, citizen scientist, coastal community, Marine protected area manager

### How are we doing it? 

Firstly we are 100% open source, so that means we will publish all plans, CAD files, build instructions on GitHub and anyone is free to download the materials and make thier own Coral Reef Mapping Drone. 

Secondly we are conducting something that we call “Social RnD” in which we invite talented and enthusiastic professionals from the community and collaborate 



Not everyone has the same skill sets or interests, so depending on your skills and in which area you would like to contribute we are spitting up into teams. 

### The 5 main design areas are: 

1. Product Design 
2. Electronic Design 
3. Software Design 
4. Artificial Intelligence 
5. Marine Biology

So, depending what you want to learn or how you want to contribute you should join one of these working groups when we start to get down to work, below the design areas are expenaded into varios skills and sub areas that we will be focusing on. 

**1. Product Design**
Mechanical design 
Fabrication
Manufacturing
3D printing
Laser Cutting

**2. Electronic Design**
Optics 
Souring of hardware components, 
Testing hardware, 
Hardware integration. 

**3. Software Design**
Coding
Information Technology
User Interface 
User Experience

**4. Artificial Intelligence**
Machine Learning 
Computer Vision
Coral Classifier 

**5. Marine Biology**
Coral identification
Environmental Data Collection 

### How can you contribute and participate ? 

The first step is to create a user account on Github and send it to michael@makerbay.org or contact@makerbay.org and we will add you to the Github team. 
The second step is to do a little background research. Don’t worry it's not too much, just to get you up to speed we have prepared some links for you to browse through
