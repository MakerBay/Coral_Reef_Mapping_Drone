Presentation of HK coral families

# Future updates
* Database of coral pictures with labels (for AI training)

# Coral Identification Notes (Maxine coral specialist session) -

* Features to look out for when distinguishing corals - 
  * Growth Factor (i.e branching, plate coral, etc) 
  * Size of the Polyps

* How to determine whether the coral is dead from the images - 
  * Covered with algae (indicates they are dead)
  * Bleaching (but the coral is still able to recover); when it is all white then it is bleached. Though when it is brown it is still alive.
  * Sea urchin colonies (indicator that there is a lot of dead coral nearby due to the algae growth - sea urchins feed on algae)

* Identifying genus only - 
  * It is difficult to differentiate between species due to similarity in appearance

* General Notes - Coral 
  * Porites (very yellow in colour) 
  * Pavona (vertical in growth; white lines)
  * Favites and Favia (has a very uniform circular shape)
  * Platygyra (has a labyrinth shape and can be smaller, as well as darker in shade)
  * Cyohastrea (irregular structure)

* General Notes - 
  * Compare lots of photos with each other because of the different lighting in each (check the colours)
  * Black and purple colour indicates coral is dead as well
  * Same colonies should have the same colour (different colour indicate different colony)
