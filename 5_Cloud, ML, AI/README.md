## AI features planned
- Coral species detection
- Coral health detection
- Fish species detection

## Current stage

### V1 of coral species detector

Will be built using Tensofrflow SSD object detection. Given an image, corals will be detected by bounding boxes.

### V2 of coral species detector

Will use image sementation to detect corals - corals will be clearly outlined 


## Proposed Pipeline 

Data collection ----> Collabrative image tagging -----> Training ----> Deployment
