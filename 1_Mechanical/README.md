# Description
This folder contains the specifications of the Drone's mechanical layout.

# New assembly
We are considering a new assembly of the drone, looking like this:

# Future updates
* New fixing point for the propellers
* Better buoyancy at the back


# Half-Circle Shape
Inspired by a bow and arrow shape, we consider the half circle shape. Here is the illustration of the shape.

By using a flexible pole and some rope for the camera support, the overall prototype looks like this.

## Videos
We have also uploaded the testing video in YouTube, where people can easily get access to it. Here is the video.

# Full-Circle Shape
As a continuation of the last version progress, we consider to double the shape into the full-circle shape. Here is the illustration of the shape.

By using the same technique from the last prototype, the overall prototype looks like this.

# Triangle Shape
Our next prototype is having a triangle shape, where the brain is located at the middle and two propellers in the left and right boat. Here is the illustration of the shape.

## Good things
* Smooth acceleration and deacceleration
* Smaller radius needed when it has to turn 360 degree

## Things to Improve
* The shape will be hard to carry if the size increases
* The shape still has a lot of flexibility, which can be unacceptable when the bigger waves coming
